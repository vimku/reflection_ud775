初始化版本库时会发生什么情况？为什么你需要这样做？
	git init
	Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Administrator/reflection/.git/
	git status
	On branch master

	No commits yet

	Untracked files:
	(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	
			lesson-2-reflection-prompts.txt
			lesson_1_reflection_prompts.txt

	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
	为了今后对项目进行版本控制
